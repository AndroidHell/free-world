# Free World

this is my final project for CIDM 4382

Uses the MEAN stack
+ mongodb - no-sql database 
+ epress - handles the models and such
+ angular - uses some ejs and HTML for templating for client-side handling of things
+ nodejs - server for the application

This project is a message board clone (like reddit, hackernews, 4chan, etc)

## functionality
+ users can create an account using an username, email and password
+ users can post new posts
+ users can upvote and downvote posts so higher voted are dynacally raised up in a list
+ users can post write a title, post a link and add a body of text to posts
+ users can comment on posts
+ users can upvote and downvote comments just like posts
+ site uses bootstrap and some custom styling to add responsive design to the application

## TODO:
+ add a user profile page
+ add user profile image
+ add functionallity to embed images into posts and comments
+ design a logo
+ make a bootstrap footer
+ refactor code to include a controller file for each model - right now there is only a single controller so it's a bit sloppy
+ add a friend system
+ add an ability to add user theme colors to bootstrap
+ eat pizza and drink beer
+ watch The Force Awakens after this semester is over
